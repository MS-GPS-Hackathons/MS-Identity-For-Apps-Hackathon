# Coach's Guide - Day 1 - Challenge 06 - Enable Conditional Access and enforce Multifactor Authentication

 [< Previous Solution](./Solution_D1_05.md) - **[Home](./README.md)** - [Next Solution >](./Solution_D1_07.md)

## Introduction

In this challenge students should enable Multifactor authentication through Conditional Access policies.

Security defaults must be disabled to enable Conditional Access policy.

When configuring the MFA security verification for user HomeUserA, advice students to select the “Mobile App” option.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) is a process in which a user is prompted for additional forms of identification during a sign-in event. For example, the prompt could be to enter a code on their cellphone or to provide a fingerprint scan. When you require a second form of identification, security is increased because this additional factor isn't easy for an attacker to obtain or duplicate.
