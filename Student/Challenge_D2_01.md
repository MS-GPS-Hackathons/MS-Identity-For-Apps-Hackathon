# Day 2 - Challenge 01 - Getting Started with Azure AD B2C

**[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge_D2_02.md)

## Introduction

After completing the previous challenges with a primary focus on Azure AD B2B, you are ready to explore the next chapter of the Azure AD Identity platform -> Azure AD B2C.

Azure AD B2C is a customer identity access management (CIAM) solution capable of supporting millions of users and billions of authentications per day. It takes care of the scaling and safety of the authentication platform, monitoring, and automatically handling threats like denial-of-service, password spray, or brute force attacks.

Azure AD B2C is a separate service from Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). It is built on the same technology as Azure AD but for a different purpose. It allows businesses to build customer facing applications, and then allow anyone to sign up into those applications with no restrictions on user account.

## Description

As a Cloud Solution Architect, you are ready to explore Azure AD B2C, which will help you realize the differences between Azure AD B2B and B2C. You discuss this with the Product team and they have asked you to create a new B2C tenant and understand the capabilities of this service.

## Success Criteria

- Demonstrate that you created an Azure AD B2C tenant.
- Explain some of the differences between Azure AD B2B and Azure AD B2C.
