# Day 2 - Challenge 05 - Branding

 [< Previous Challenge](./Challenge_D2_04.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Challenge >](./Challenge_D2_06.md)

## Introduction

We have a working app. Now it is time for some branding. The goal here is to explore different customization options and implement basic branding for sign in process.

## Description

AAD allows to configure custom branding options. You can create language-specific versions, experiment with colours, logos, and texts. As this challenge concentrates on identity and access control, the scope covers only sign in experience. Basic company branding for AAD B2C allows you to set background image, banner logo and background colour. 

If it is not enough, you have option to create a custom HTML page for sign up/sign in and add JavaScript to introduce additional options like showing or hiding password or adding Terms of Use checkbox. You can also embed AAD B2C sign-in user interface directly into your web application. 

For today, your product team wants you to test following options:

- Language customization
- Basic sign-in page with custom logo of your choice.

Additionally, there is a special request to have different logo for each language version.

## Success Criteria

To complete this challenge successfully, you should be able to:

- Customize sign-in page using your logo or chosen image 
- Enable at least one chosen language other than English for your sign in flow.
- Demonstrate that you can have different branding depending on language version
- Discuss how you can achieve further customization and better branding using AAD B2C
